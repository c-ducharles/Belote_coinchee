# Belote_coinchee (2021)
A classic game of "Belote" adapted on computer

My game allows you to play a French card game named "Belote", however here is not the original version but a variant called "Belote coinch√©e"

This game is only a single player game and the ally as well as the ennemies are AI that plays in function of the card and the situations.

To play it, download the project and then go to bin/debug/coinche.exe which is the executable for the game.

Enjoy ;)
